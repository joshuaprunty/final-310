GPT4 Functionality Ideas
---------------------------------------------------

Data Visualization:
  Interactive Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards using AWS QuickSight to visualize player performance trends, odds changes, 
  and other metrics. The backend can aggregate data and push it to QuickSight for visualization.

Predictive Modeling:
  Player Performance Predictions: Develop a machine learning model to predict player performance based on historical data and current 
  projections. Use AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment.

Data Cleaning and Normalization:
  Data Validation and Normalization: Implement a robust data pipeline to clean and normalize data from the PrizePicks API before 
  storing it. Use AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.

Performance Monitoring:
  Player Performance Monitoring: Monitor player performance in real-time during games and update projections accordingly. Use AWS 
  IoT Core to stream real-time data and Lambda for processing.

Advanced Filtering and Searching:
  Advanced Search Functionality: Implement advanced search and filtering capabilities for users to find specific projections based 
  on multiple criteria. Use Elasticsearch Service on AWS for indexing and searching.

Comparative Analysis:
  Comparison with Market Odds: Compare PrizePicks projections with odds from other sportsbooks and highlight discrepancies. Use 
  Lambda for fetching and comparing data from different sources.

Custom Alerts and Notifications:
  User-Defined Alerts: Allow users to set custom alerts for specific players or events. Use AWS DynamoDB to store user preferences 
  and SNS for notifications.

Integration with Betting Platforms:
  Seamless Integration: Integrate the service with online betting platforms to allow users to place bets directly based on insights. 
  Use AWS API Gateway to create secure API endpoints for integration.
